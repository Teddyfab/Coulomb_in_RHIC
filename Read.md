This routine is able to model relativistic nuclear after collision that includes the Coulomb effect on the trajectories of those particles and see what difference does coulomb bring to the differential elliptic flow. 

The code should follow the particles from the expansion stage past the decoupling. It starts defining the hot spot and let pions get generated immediately having their momentum from the collision energy.
 
 It does not consider either the thermal force nor the damping viscous force whose impulse  finally affects the flow.
