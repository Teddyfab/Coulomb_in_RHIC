Find out the effect of coulomb force on the elliptic flow of particles from high energy nuclear collision
To begin, the code will simulate some positive and negative particles (more positive than negative) scattering from an originally elliptic anisotropy propagating the particles forward with collisions and generating elliptic flow, then see if elliptic flow is measurably different between the + and - particles including Coulomb forces..
